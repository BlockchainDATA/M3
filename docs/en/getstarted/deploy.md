# Deploy the Web Project

Web Module is a web front end of the routing library.

It now supply a few REST APIs.

You can operate the DHT node of a server through these APIs.

Some more functions will be integrate into this web front.

Just copy the following war file to the tomcat's webapps directory.

```
routing-web/build/libs/routing-web.war
```

## Notice

There is some hard coding in routing-api, so do not modify the war file's name.

This will fix soon.
